# OakSamples

A number of simple examples to demonstrate use of the Digistump Oak board and connectivity to Particle.io.

Full details of Oak are here: [http://digistump.com/]

NOTE:
These are intended to be used from the Arduino IDE to upload OTA to the target device - details on how to configure this is here: [http://digistump.com/wiki/oak/tutorials/arduino]
